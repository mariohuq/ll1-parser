# LL(1) Parser

An LL(1) parser made in C++ with STL libraries.

Like the original program, it prints out the first, follow, parse table and checks if the given input string is accepted by the given grammar.

Also, it generates random string that accepted by the grammar (enter `!`).


## Usage
Compile the code with g++ and run with arguments `<grammar-file>`

Grammar file contains all the productions for the grammar:

* Each line contains a production for the grammar in the format `LHS -> RHS`
* All upper case alphabets are non-terminals or variables.
* The letter `e` is considered as empty string or epsilon.
* Dollar sign is used as end character.
* Any other character is taken as a terminal for the grammar.

Sample Usage:

```bash
g++ parser.cpp -o parser
./parser grammar1.txt
```

Output:
```text
Grammar parsed from grammar file:
0.  S -> AB
1.  A -> a
2.  A -> e
3.  B -> b
4.  B -> e

The non terminals in the grammar are: A B S
The terminals in the grammar are: $ a b

Firsts list:
A : a e
B : b e
S : a b e

Follows list:
A : $ b
B : $
S : $

Parsing Table:
   $ a b
A  2 1 2
B  4 - 3
S  0 0 0

> a
Input string is accepted
```
